I designed and printed t-shirts for my math class at LCC. The letters are fractals: the L is a [golden dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) and the C's are [LÃ©vy C curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_C_curve). I drew them with recursive JavaScript functions on an HTML5 2D canvas.

We wore the shirts on our allegedly educational trip to the amusement park Canada's Wonderland.
