*To my friend Paul Toner*

This tool generates random characters or words. It shows the entropy of the generated string, which is the number of distinct strings of given length and character set. The greater the entropy, the stronger the password.

According to [this xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/936/), a password composed of random common words is memorable yet has sufficient entropy to be strong.
